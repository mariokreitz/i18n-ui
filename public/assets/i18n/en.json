        "a": "You can use it via the interactive CLI in your project directory, or integrate it programmatically in your build process. The tool works with the standard i18n structure (e.g., public/assets/i18n or src/assets/i18n).",

      },
      "nestedKeys": {
        "a": "Yes, absolutely. Nested objects are automatically flattened into dot-notation when exporting to Excel (e.g., 'header.title') and restored back to the original nested structure when importing from Excel to JSON.",
